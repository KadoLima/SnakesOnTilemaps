# SnakesOnTilemaps
This is a study about Unity's tilemap system. I've worked with the tool before but I haven't had the opportunity to make games using it recently, that's why I decided to recreate the classic Snakes game using Tilemaps. All behaviours in this game were created using functions related to the Tilemaps system.
